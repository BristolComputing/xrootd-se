<!-- storage.xml for T2_UK_SGrid_Bristol

    Storage element:  xrootd.phy.bris.ac.uk
    Storage software: XROOTD 5.3.2

    All CMS data are stored using the /store convention
    Therefore need to map:
           /+store/(.*)
    and pass through for everything else
    
    Special case: LoadTest. Needs to come first for every type of mapping.
